Description: Perform parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC: Hitchcock, 1927)
	<doi:10.1002/sapm192761164> on fluorescence excitation-emission
	matrices (FEEMs): handle scattering signal and inner filter
	effect, scale the dataset, fit the model; perform split-half
	validation or jack-knifing. A modified approach called
	"randomised split-half" is also available. The package has a low
	dependency footprint (only two direct dependencies not in core
	or recommended; four total non-core/recommended dependencies)
	and has been tested on a wide range of R versions (including R
	as old as 3.3.3 from Debian Stretch).
