\section{Changes in version 0.1-2}{\itemize{
  \item Fixed a bug in \code{feemjackknife} and \code{feemsplithalf}, which
  could manifest when \code{rescale} argument is not \code{3} and loading
  scales are wildly different, resulting in poor approximation for some of
  the modes.

  \item Made the information for PARAFAC/split-half/jack-knife plots more
  prominent.

  \item Made tests and examples much faster.

  \item Made the \code{gamma} argument in \code{marine.colours} much more
  useful.

  \item Minor improvements in documentation.
